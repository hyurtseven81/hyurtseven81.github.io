# Huseyin Yurtseven's README
## About me

* I’ve been developing software for over 20 years
* I love learning new things and applying them to my day-to-day life
* I'm an empathetic person
* I believe in management by objectives
* I’m always data-driven
* I have a [Defender](https://www.16personalities.com/isfjs-at-work) personality
* I’m the happiest if there is a clear structure and expectations
* I always chase best practices for everything, meeting standards, process management, leadership styles, and so on
* I read a lot, mainly technical books and leadership books
* When I see a new problem, I’m always excited to jump in and learn and try to solve it
* I never hesitate to work at any level, I love coding, and I love leadership at any level
* I love seeing the long-term vision, and I could be unhappy if there is no plan for one year ahead
* I value:
    * Positive intent
    * Ownership
    * Decisions are taken by consensus
    * Frugality
    * Creating Impact/Value
* I love [Amazon’s leadership principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/en/principles)

## My Tenets
1. **No Hand-offs:** Cross-functional micro-teams within value streams prevent unnecessary delays and maintain motivation across functions.
2. **Working Solution over Documentation:** Prioritizing practical, working solutions and iterative delivery helps accelerate progress and continuous improvement over extensive documentation for our customers.
3. **Psychological Safety:** Fostering an environment where team members feel safe to speak up, take risks, and make mistakes without fear, supporting creativity, innovation, and resilience.
4. **Teamwork over Individual Work:** Emphasizing collective success, we value teamwork, where each member’s contribution enhances the whole.
5. **No Bus Factor:** Encouraging practices like pair programming and role switching, we promote knowledge sharing to minimize dependencies on any single individual.
6. **Knowledge-sharing:** A shared understanding across topics enhances decision-making and supports continuous learning and growth.
7. **Smaller Cross-Functional Teams over Large Teams:** Effective communication is more achievable within smaller, cross-functional teams, optimizing alignment and agility.
8. **Goal-Driven over Roadmap-Driven:** Through clear Objectives and Key Results, we empower teams to define initiatives, maximizing value and focus on impactful outcomes.
9. **Manager as a Multiplier:** Managers serve as multipliers, developing and empowering team members to amplify their impact and foster high performance.
10. **Optimizing Cognitive Load:** Prioritizing manageable workloads and effective team structure to avoid overload, with the support of platform and enabling teams.
11. **Brooks Law:** Adopting an “own-it end-to-end” philosophy, we focus on “you build it, you run it” to enhance accountability and delivery quality.
12. **Making Work Visible:** Visible workflows, such as sprint reports and showcase meetings, strengthen trust within and among teams by improving transparency and alignment.

## How you can help me



* I take hard feedback well; deliver feedback as much as possible
    * Most of the time, you might see me asking and chasing feedback from you; be ready for it
* Please keep me in the information flow instead of preparing reports and regular updates. If you feel I’m missing some important information or decision, ping me with just one sentence on slack. If necessary, I will ask for more information. But before everything, try to keep me in the loop
* If there is a consensus decision, there is no need to involve me, but if you feel that decision will live with us for at least one year and is an important decision, involve me in the first place
* I love problems and debates on top of them, don’t forget to invite me to the party. If I feel I don’t live in the problem space, I might be an unhappy person easily
* I love pair/[mob programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming), but with a remote work setup, if you don’t invite me, I cannot invite myself, so please remember me
* Unless specifically mentioned, I don’t expect immediate responses from anyone. I respect others’ time and want you to have the space for a thoughtful response.


## My working style



* I believe in the [servant leadership](https://wheniwork.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-the-servant-leadership-model/) model
* I’m a fan of situational leadership; therefore, if you see me giving specific instructions or coaching you on a particular topic, it means that I’m trying to apply situational leadership to that specific situation
* I prefer written decisions with [RFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments)s/[ADR](https://adr.github.io)s
* There should be a structure/best practice for everything; it’s always ok to invent something new if there is a structure under it. Some things help me to be structured:
    * [Situational leadership](https://situational.com/situational-leadership/)
    * [Team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com)
    * [Data mesh](https://martinfowler.com/articles/data-mesh-principles.html)
    * [Domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)
    * [Event storming meetings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_storming)
    * [Independent service heuristics](https://github.com/TeamTopologies/Independent-Service-Heuristics)
    * Architecture reviews
    * Incident management process
    * [OKRs](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1d0rFtpi7FI9OevvlSRWDBb5dlNB53neH/edit)
    * [Executive actions teams](https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/0/d/1425DgeGvRsiaBhxvSuAIu5go-Ur7V6cU/edit)
* OKR framework is the key framework for me to follow the management by objectives approach
* I respond well to being asked for help ("Can you help with X?"). I don't respond well to being told what to do ("Do X!")
* I believe in [empowered teams](https://www.svpg.com/empowered-product-teams/).
    * I have always hated being a [code monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_monkey), and I don’t want anyone working with me to be one
    * **Come with problems to solve, not with solutions to code!**
* I look for small, incremental deliverables and a willingness to work on any task
* I change a lot by my new learnings; if you see me defending a new idea, that means I learned something new and digested that information and changed myself accordingly
* I want to earn your trust. I want to allow you the space to take calculated risks, be vulnerable with me, and also tell me when I could be doing something better. [Psychological safety](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/emotional-intelligence/psychological-safety/) is extremely important to me and I promise to never hold a failed project against you if it was based on sound assumptions.
* I believe in the [first-team/second team](https://youtu.be/BjE_mPoZPSg) model
    * I believe that leaders should be a team
* I do informal performance reviews to be ready for the formal one for all of us every 3 months so that we can clarify expectations as early as possible
* [Effective time management](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11OcsFuceN2WW1aa3sXBB9jAj3oVeW4Tx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=117472000879558257694&rtpof=true&sd=true) is the key to all above
* I work mostly on weekends and the evenings for my own development as well as for duties that I cannot fulfill in the day due to my other/main responsibilities. I don't expect the same from you or I don't reward this behavior


### Your development

I believe that your career progression is your responsibility, but I’m always here to help:



* to ask you annoying questions about your progress
* to be a "study buddy" and grow/learn together
* to help you find projects that require you to learn in a certain area
* to broadcast your successes
* to challenge you


### Feedback

I always prefer [radically candid](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Kim-Scott/dp/1250258405/ref=pd_lpo_1?pd_rd_i=1250258405&psc=1) feedback. Therefore I always try to deliver timely and continuous feedback, and I expect you to do the same thing to me.


### 1o1s

This is your meeting and your time: you set the agenda and determine what we talk about. My most effective 1:1s have an agenda that builds up through the week, but I've also had some great free-form ones. Don't feel bad if you don't come with something prepared.

If we don't have anything on the agenda, please expect me to try and get to know you better.

If you're struggling to find some topics, use the [Rose/Thorn/Bud](https://www.mindfulschools.org/inspiration/mindful-reflection/) framework and come up with them. I like hearing about problems/things that happened during your week because:



* I always learn something
* I get data points that help me make global process improvements
* I get a picture of what things you're great at
* I begin to understand which things you struggle with

I do also schedule [skip level 1o1s](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/leadership/skip-levels/) quarterly, be ready that I will be reaching out to your team members quarterly basis to have 1o1s with them. Keep in your mind that skip level 1o1s is not for checking the leader’s performance. It’s just for getting to know each other and building rapport, providing an opportunity to have contributions recognized by a senior leader, asking questions, and clarifying their understanding of the company or functional objectives.

**Don't save urgent matters for a 1-1**


### Trust

My default position is to trust everyone, be it work-related or not. I see people as they can share any information with me very openly, and I’m also always open to them. 

At work, I will trust that intentions are good by default. I will often provide feedback if I see something that I find is not beneficial to the company, whether that is my job or not. I will give direct feedback to individuals of all ranks if I observe this behavior.

If I feel my sincere feedback is not helpful to improve things despite my repeated attempts (I’m patient enough to provide the same feedback again), I tend to react by withdrawing the trust entirely, and sometimes I cannot build that trust environment again.

For this reason, I ask people working with me to always provide me direct feedback on time and respond to my feedback timely without holding back.


### What I expect from a leader

I expect a leader should be powerful in multiple disciplines; therefore, the right leader should be a [T-Shaped leader](https://hbr.org/2001/03/introducing-t-shaped-managers-knowledge-managements-next-generation) in high-level disciplines as well as inside technical disciplines:

To me, the right leader should be a life-long learner in any topic. 

The right leader should be:

## What I assume about others



* I assume that you’re good at your job

## Communicating with me

I believe in open communication, and I’m always responsive; you can reach me out in any way, and I do my best to respond as soon as possible.

I can follow your style; if you prefer written communication, I can move forward with the written format. If you prefer verbal communication, we can jump in a call and start talking. 

After all, I believe I’m here to help you.

Don’t hesitate to reach out from slack, WhatsApp, email, or call me directly anytime (depending on the urgency of the topic), or don’t hesitate to send a meeting request by checking my calendar (my calendar is always up-to-date)
